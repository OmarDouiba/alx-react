# 0x02-react_props

## 5- Props

- Props stands for properties
- Props are like Html attributes (name="value")
- they can pass data from a parent components to is child components

```js
App // parent
<Header title="hello world"> // child

// Header component
// we can access title inside header Component
<header>{props.title}</header>
```

- It' like

```js
props = {
    title:"hello world",
    age: 40
}
App // parent
<Header title="hello world" age="40"> // child

// Header component
// we can access title inside header Component
<header>{props.title} {props.age}</header>
```

- components can't change the props they're read-only.

## [Keys](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html#keys)

when we make list in React we shouls always use the Key keywords, to identify each list item, and it will also help us to manipulate list items.

```js
function NumberList(props) {
  const numbers = props.numbers;
  return (
    <ul>
      {numbers.map((number) => (
        <ListItem key={number.toString()} value={number} />
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

## [Fragment](https://react.dev/reference/react/Fragment)

## [Test]()

To develop your tests faster, you can watch them. The test suite will run for every change you make:

- Add the following script to task_1/package.json

````js
"test-watch": "jest --watch"```
````

- Run your suite using

```js
npm run test-watch
```

#### shallow

- import { shallow } from "enzyme";
  it's a function provided by enzyme that allows us to render a component one level deep and ensures that it doesn't render it cild components.
  which means it isolate components you're testing from it's children.

````js
const wrapper = shallow(<MyComponent />);```
````

## [PropTypes](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-proptypes-in-react/)

#### What are PropTypes?

ropTypes are simply a mechanism that ensures that the passed value is of the correct datatype. This makes sure that we donâ€™t receive an error at the very end of our app by the console which might not be easy to deal with.

#### How to use PropTypes

- npm install prop-types --save
  We can use PropTypes to validate any data we are receiving from props

we should import PropTypes in our app

```js
import PropTypes from "prop-types";
function Test(props) {
  // ...Code
}

Test.propTypes = {
  // key: value
  // key: value
  //// key is the name of the prop and
  // value is the PropType
};

export default Test;
```

#### Basic Types of PropTypes

ist of all data types that are considered primitive or the basic ones with their classes that we can use to check props.

- EX:

```js
Test.propTypes = {
  name: PropTypes.string,
  age: PropTypes.number,
  address: PropTypes.object,
  friends: PropTypes.array,
};
```

#### Collective Type

![image](1.jpg)

```js
Test.propTypes = {
  counts: PropTypes.array,
  users: PropTypes.arrayOf(PropTypes.object),
  alarmColor: PropTypes.oneOf(["red", "blue"]),
  description: PropTypes.oneOfType([
    PropTypes.string,
    PropTypes.instanceOf(Title),
  ]),
};
```

#### Object Types

![image](2.jpg)

```js
Count.propTypes = {
  basicObject: PropTypes.object,
  numbers: PropTypes.objectOf(PropTypes.numbers),
  messages: PropTypes.instanceOf(Message),
  contactList: PropTypes.shape({
    name: PropTypes.string,
    phone: PropTypes.string,
  }),
};
```

#### How to Check for a React Component

If you want to just check to see if a prop is a React component, you can use PropTypes.element. This is useful for ensuring that a component only ever has one child component.

![image](3.jpg)

```js
Test.propTypes = {
  displayEle: PropTypes.element,
};
```

#### How to Check for a React Component Name

Finally, we can check to see if the prop is the name of a React component by using PropTypes.elementType.

```js
Component.propTypes = {
  as: PropTypes.elementType,
};
```

```js
<AnotherComponent as={Component} />
```

#### Default PropTypes

Sometimes, we want to be able to set a default value for a prop. For instance, our parent component might not require a title to be passed. But we still want a title to be rendered.

In cases like this, we can set a default value for our title which will automatically be rendered if the title has not been passed as a prop from our parent component.

```js
NotificationItem.defaultProps = {
  type: "default",
  html: "",
  value: "",
};
```
